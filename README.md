## My process
1. At the beggining I added html tags and classes to the elements
2. Started working on each element starting from the biggest one ("container" class finishing on images)
3. Created responsive desktop and mobile view
4. After finishing all above I started to work on README.md

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

I reinforced my css skills

### Continued development

Continue working on making more "pretty" css and html code, work more on new css possibilities, at some point also to start adding js and also some Python code (I am familiar with python-flask, flask-wtf, flask-login, flask-sqlalchemy)

### Useful resources
